-- 1. What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

SELECT

-- 4. What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?

-- Berechne die monatlichen Aktionen. Das anschließenden Summieren der Aktionen Ergibt die balance je Monat. 
-- Zuletzt wird die Summe je Customer berechnet und der letzte Stand ausgewählt.
